  # This workflow uses the pull_request trigger which prevents write permissions and secrets
  # access to the target repository from public forks.  This should remain as a pull_request
  # trigger because checkout, build, format and checking for changes do not need elevated
  # permissions to the repository.  The reduced permissions for public forks is adequate.
